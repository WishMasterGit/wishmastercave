Here is the question. What if developer can make feature or program or task in time, without bugs and meeting all
the requirements you asked for? Does he still required to put backlog items into the tracking system?
Let's extend the question. What if whole team can do that. Make the release and hit the deadline. With minimum issues and
well done in terms of business logic. Does this team still need to track anything in tools like Trello/Jira or similar?

It is the hard one. It seems like the obvious. That yeah, they don't need to, they meet ultimate goal of their work. And you
of course will and should be sceptic about that. One might say that it is impossible.

I can tell you it is possible I've seen people and even teams who able to do staff without classic SCRUM or similar techniques.
The magic of this thing is quite interesting. If you will interview those people or teams you will find next things (this what I found
you probably will find even more):

- Before doing anything they think and speak alot, they using all possible techniques to understand what need to be done
- They making the general strategy on how to achieve the goal. Some store this strategy in mind, some write it down on paper some uses software solutions for that
- When they starting the work they split up it to achievable units and follow the strategy they got in the beginning
- Time to time they are reviewing strategy and adjusting it to the conditions
- When it team they usually meet or use chats to discuss this things.

Now you can see that it is not far from classic SCRUM or Agile development and at the same time it is really far on the approach.

Each person and each team has own thought process and planning mechanisms. Sometime they fit classic SCRUM rules when you split things to backlog items, than plan sprints etc. But many times it is not. And what persons or teams trying to do, they trying to fit their system to the introduced from outside. And many most times it creates lot of overheads and miscommunications. Instead of helping teams SCRUM just making visibility of work, while people or teams struggling on background and usually have own plans/strategies outlined somewhere else. Basically team forced to do double work while it can be one.

Approach that can be proposed here is next. Instead of introducing the system. Let team or people start working. See how they do in global terms, does they deliver or not in agreed terms or deadlines. And than ask questions on how they doing that. If they successfully you will be able to find new practice that could potentially be generalized and help other teams. If they not you can start introduce some parts of other practices that are successful and see how they work for particular team/person. Some will, some will not. Those are not working you should remove and try to find working one.

Nowdays in software engineering we are skipping this step. And just moving blindly with whatever being proposed by Project manager/Coach/Consultant. I do recommend for each team to go through period of exploration. And then revisit it time to time.
