## Things to bring

- balls from either volleyball, basketball or soccer but there no field for soccer, you can probably find some place anyway
- there are tennis court and even some equipment for it, but if you are serious probably it's good to bring yours
- Lot of board games, it is dedicated space with tables and fireplace for that, It's shared space and you can engage others in your games  
- table tennis table, in bad condition but you can try, just bring your rackets and balls
- Bicycle, there is some area you can bike around and lot of space for kid
- Staff for pool could be use full as well
